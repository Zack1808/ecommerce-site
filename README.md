# E-commerce Website

## About the website

This is a simple e-commerce website that uses [commerce.js](https://commercejs.com) to store and manage the items and uses [stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js) to carry out the purchase.
It also uses some components from the [Material UI](https://mui.com);
Since the page was setup so that there can only be made test puchases, it would be adviseable to enter the number 42 inside the card information field until it is filled up, since that is the test card for [stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js).
The website was published at [github pages](https://zack1808.github.io/ecommerce-site).
